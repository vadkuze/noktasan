## Before the start of the project it is necessary:
* Make sure that the node.js and npm are installed. For this write in the terminal
> node -v

If you look at the version, for example, v6.9.2 then everything is ok

> npm -v

If you look at the version, for example, v4.3.0 then everything is ok

* Make sure that gulp version 4 is installed, since if it is less, it will not work. 
If it is not installed then install:

> npm install gulpjs/gulp-cli#4.0 -g


## Instructions for starting the project:
* Declare this repository

* Run the npm install command in the terminal. This command will install all the packages and dependencies that are specified in the file packege.json

* Run the command 'gulp' which will compile the project into the build folder
